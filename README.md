# SnakeGameProject
This project aims to develop a Python-based Snake Game, using six stages of development, such as: Planning, Testing, Proof of Concept (POC), Replanning + Database Integration, Containerization and Deployment. In this game, players control a snake to consume food items and grow in length while avoiding obstacles and self-collision. The game provides customization options, comprehensive testing, and deployment using Docker for scalability and management. You can take a look at the task descriptions of projects linked to this repository for much more detailed project documentation and descriptions.
